# WeatherDashboardChallenge6
This is a challenge to create a weather dashboard using server-side APIs

## Functionality
The purpose of this website is to take user input and provide real-time weather, as well as a 5 day forecast of weather for the same area.

Using openweather API, the site is able to retrieve several required specifications from the API and display them.  The 5 day forecast is displayed dynamically in a format that updates with the new user input.
